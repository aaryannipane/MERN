Node.js File Server
Now we know how to parse the query string, and in the previous chapter we learned how to make Node.js behave as a file server. Let us combine the two, and serve the file requested by the client.

Create two html files and save them in the same folder as your node.js files.

Create a Node.js file that opens the requested file and returns the content to the client. If anything goes wrong, throw a 404 error:

then run server 
then open http://localhost:8080/summer.html
or http://localhost:8080/winter.html

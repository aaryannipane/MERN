Difference between Function Component and Class Component in React JS

Use functional components if you are writing a presentational component
which doesn't have its own state or needs to access a lifecycle hook. You
cannot use setState() in your component because Functional Components are
plain JavaScript functions,

Use class Components if you need state or need to access lifecycle hook
because all lifecycle hooks are coming from the React.Component which you
extend from in class components.

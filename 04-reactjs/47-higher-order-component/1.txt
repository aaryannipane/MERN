Higher Order Component
A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing
component logic.
HOCs are common in third-party React libraries.
A HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.
Syntax:-
const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);
Ex:-
const FacebookJob = withLanguage(ReactJS)

const Army = withArm(Men) { training }

const Army = (Men) => { training }

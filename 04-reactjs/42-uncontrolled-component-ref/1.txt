refs:-
Refs provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the
render method.

When to Use Refs
- Managing focus, text selection, or media playback.
- Triggering imperative animations.
- Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.

CREATING REFS:-
Refs are created using React.createRef() and attached to React elements via the
ref attribute.
Refs are commonly assigned to an instance property when a component is
constructed so they can be referenced throughout the component.
// Create a ref to store the DOM element
this.myRef = React.createRef();
render() {
// Attaching created ref to react element
return <div ref={this.myRef} />;

ACCESSING REFS:-
When a ref'is passed to an element in render, a reference to the node becomes accessible at the current attribute of the ref.
const node = this.myRef.current;
React will assign the current property with the DOM element when the component mounts, and
assign it back to null when it unmounts.
The value of the ref differs depending on the type of the node:
* When the ref attribute is used on an HTML element, the ref created in the constructor with
React.createRef{) receives the underlying DOM element as its current property.

* When the ref attribute is used on a custom class component, the ref object receives the
mounted instance of the component as its current.

* You may not use the ref attribute on function components because they donâ€™t have instances.

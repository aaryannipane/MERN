STRICT MODE
StrictMode is a tool for highlighting potential problems in an application.
StrictMode does not render any visible UL It activates additional checks and warnings for its
descendants.
Strict mode checks are run in development mode only; they do not impact the production build.
Ex:-
<React.StrictMode>
    <User />
</React.StrictMode>


StrictMode currently helps with:

* Identifying components with unsafe lifecycles

* Warning about legacy string ref API usage

* Warning about deprecated findDOMNode usage
* Detecting unexpected side effects

* Detecting legacy context API

CALLBACK REFS
React also supports another way to set refs called “callback refs”, which gives
more fine-grain control over when refs are set and unset.

Instead of passing a ref attribute created by createRef(), you pass a function.
The function receives the React component instance or HTML DOM element
as its argument, which can be stored and accessed else where.

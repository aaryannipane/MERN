Composing Components

Components can refer to other components in their output. 
This lets us use the same component abstraction for any level of detail.


Ex:
  function Student(){
    return <h1>Hello Rahul</h1>
  }
  
  function App(){
    return(
      <div>
        <Student/>
        <Student/>
        <Student/>
      </div>
    )
  }

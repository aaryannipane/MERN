render Method createElement Method and ReactDOM render Method in React JS 


render() METHOD:- 
  The render() method is the only required method in a class component. It examines this.props and this.state.
  It returns one of the following types:
    React elements These are created via JSX(Not required).
    For example, <div /> and <App /> are React elements that instruct React to render a DOM node, or another
    user-defined component, respectively.

  Arrays and fragments - It is used to return multiple elements from render.
  Portals - It is used to render children into a different DOM subtree.
  String and numbers - These are rendered as text nodes in the DOM.
  Booleans or null - It renders nothing. (Mostly exists to support return test && <Child /> pattern, where test is
  boolean.)

  Note - The render() function should be pure, meanig that it does not modify component state, it returns the
  same result each time it's invoked, and it does not directly interact with the browser.


React Element :- 
  You can create a react element using React.createElement(0 method but there 1s a easy
  way to create element via JSX.

  Using createElement() Method
    React.createElement("hl", null, "Hello GeckyShows");

  Using JSX (RECOMMENDED)
    <hl>Hello GeekyShows</hl>

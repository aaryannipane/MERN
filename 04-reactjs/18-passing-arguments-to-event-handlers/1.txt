Passing Arguments to Event Handlers in React JS

Arrow Function
  <button onClick={(e) => this.handleclick(id, e)}>Delete</button>

Bind Method
  <button onClick={this.handleClick.bind(this, id)}>Delete</button>

Note:
  -In both cases, the e argument representing the React event will be passed as a second
  argument after the ID.
  -With an arrow function, we have to pass it explicitly, but with bind any further arguments are
  automatically forwarded.

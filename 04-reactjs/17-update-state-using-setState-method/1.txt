Update State using setState Method in React JS


setState() Method is used to update states.
Ex:-
  this.state = {name: "Rahul"}

  this.setState({name: "Jai"});



UPDATE STATE :- 
  this.setState(function(state, props) {
    return{

    }
  }

  -It accepts a function rather than an object.
  -It receives the previous state as the first argument,
  -The props at the time the update is applied as the second argument.

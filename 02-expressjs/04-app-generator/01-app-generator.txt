Use the application generator tool, express-generator, to quickly create an application skeleton.


1) to use this application generator we have to install express-generator globaly using below command
>> npm install express-generator -g

2) then display the command options with the -h option
>> express -h

3) to create app with name ejsapp in current directory and view engine as ejs write below command
>> express --view=ejs ejsapp
        OR for pug use --view=pug

4) now cd to ejsapp then run command "npm install" 

5) we have to work in ejsapp/views/index.ejs   file

6) in ejsapp run command to start server
>> set DEBUG=ejsapp:* & npm start

7) then load to http://localhost:3000/

8) now to change the express word on the webpage  goto ejsapp/routes/index.js there will be res.render()
inside it there is object that contains title value as express that we can change to any value

9) now we can create new variables and add value of it in that object that is in routes/index.js 
 and use that variables in our index.ejs file

10) ejs is same like php

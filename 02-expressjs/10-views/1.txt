VIEW 
    Views contain the HTML served by your application and separate your application logic
    from your presentation logic. Views are stored in the views directory.

    Creating View :--
    views/index.html 

    <html>
        <body>
            <h1>Hello Home Page</h1>
        </body>
    </html>


CREATE ROUTE FOR VIEW 

    Example:
    import {join} from 'path'
    app.get('/', (req, res)=> {
        res.sendFile(join(process.cwd(), 'views', 'index.html'))
    })

    process.cwd() - process is node's global object, and .cwd() returns where node is
    running.

    app.sendFile() - This is used to transfers the file at the given path. Sets the Content-
    Type response HTTP header field based on the filename's extension. Unless the root
    option is set in the options object, path must be an absolute path to the file.

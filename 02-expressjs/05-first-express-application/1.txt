FIRST EXPRESS APP 

const express = require('express');  // old method

import express from 'express';  // es6 method 

const app = express();

const port = process.env.PORT || '3000';

app.get('/', (req, res)=>{
    res.send("Hello World);
})

app.listen(port, ()=>{
    console.log(`server running on port ${port}`);
})



express()-The express() function is a top-level function exported by the express
module.

const app = express()
The app returned by express() is in fact a JavaScript Function, designed to be passed to Node's HTTP servers as a callback to handle requests.
This makes it easy to provide both HTTP and HTTPS versions of your app with the
same code base, as the app does not inherit from these.

app.listen() - It binds and listens for connections on the specified host and port.
If port is omitted or is 0, the operating system will assign an arbitrary unused port,
which is useful for cases like automated tasks.


to use new JavaScript 
open package.json file 
then add 

"type": "module",

when we add this then require() function will give error in our js file 
so we have to change that line to 

import express from 'express'

ROUTE PARAMETER

Route parameters are named URL segments that are used to capture the values specified at their
position in the URL.
The captured values are populated in the req.params object, with the name of the route
parameter specified in the path as their respective keys.
The name of route parameters must be made up of "word characters" ([A-Za-z0-9_]).

Examples:-
/student/:id                            // www.example.com/student/12
/product/:category/:id                  // www.example.com/product/mobile/23
/product/order/:year/and/:month         // www.example.com/order/2021/and/oct
/train/:from-:to                        // www.example.com/train/ranchi-dhanbad
/location/:state.:city                  // www.example.com/location/jh.ranchi

req.params = {"state":"jh", "city":"ranchi"}



ROUTE PARAMETER WITH REGX:- 

To have more control over the exact string that can be matched by a route parameter, you can
append a regular expression in parentheses (()).

Example:
/student/:sid([O-9]{12})                      // www.example.com/student/12
/product/order/:year/and/:month([a-z])       // www.example.com/order/2021/and/oct

ROUTE PARAMETER :- 
    app.param()- The app.param() function is used to add the callback triggers to route parameters.
    It is commonly used to check for the existence of the data requested related to the route
    parameter.
    All param callbacks will be called before any handler of any route in which the param occurs,
    and they will each be called only once in a request-response cycle, even if the parameter is
    matched in multiple routes.

    Syntax:-
    app.param(name, callback)
    app.param([name1, name2, ....], callback)
    id name is an array , the callback trigger is register for each parameter declared in it ,
    in the order in which they are declared


QUERY STRING (very important)

/product                                // www.example.com/product?category=mobile
req.query = {"category":"mobile"}        

/product                                // www.example.com/product?category=mobile&id=13
req.query = {"category":"mobile", "id":13}

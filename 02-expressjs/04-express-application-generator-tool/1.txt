Express Application Generator Tool

    Use the application generator tool, express-generator, to quickly create an application
    skeleton.

    npx express-generator --view=ejs myapp
        // OR 
    npm install -g express-generator
    express-view=ejs myapp

    then goto myapp folder 
    
    npm install

    set DEBUG=myapp:* & npm start



myapp -Application/Project Folder

bin - The bin folder contains the exccutable file that starts your app. It starts the
server (on port 3000, if no alternative is supplied) and sets up some basic error
handling.

public - Everything in this folder is accessible to people connecting to application.
We can put JavaScript, CSS, images, and other assets.

routes - We can put all our route files. The generator creates two files, index.js and
users.js.

views - The views folder is where we have files used by your templating engine.

app.js File - This file creates an express application object (named app, by
convention), sets up the application with various settings and middleware, and then
exports the app from the module.
